# Here's how to get it running:

WINDOWS
- In the main branch (before you clicked this README file), click the "<> Code" section
- Click "Download ZIP" at the bottom
- Locate the ZIP folder in your downloads and extract it
- Open the extracted folder until you reach the location of the "main" file and keep a file explorer tab there
- Go to the terminal by pressing the Windows key and searching "terminal"
- Make sure you have Python 3 installed, as well as the library "pygame" (there's plenty of tutorials on YouTube on how to install these)
- Go to the top of file explorer and copy the file directory <CTRL+C>
- Type "cd <CTRL+V>", which should put you in the correct file directory
- Type "python main.py", it should work once you type that in!

If you wanna play with a different time instead of the default 2/3/5/10 seconds, here's how you do it:
- Go into the "main.py" file with a text editor like Notepad
- Find the "DIFFICULTY TIMES IN SECONDS" section
- Change a difficulty's number (which is in seconds) and select that difficulty in the menu!
- For example, if I wanna change the SUPERHUMAN difficulty time to 0.5 seconds, I'd change its number from 2 to 0.5
