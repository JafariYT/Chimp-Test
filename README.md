Here's how to get it running:

Windows
- In the main branch (before you clicked this README file), click the "<> Code" section
- Click "Download ZIP" at the bottom
- Locate the ZIP folder in your downloads and extract it
- Open the extracted folder until you reach the location of the "main" file and keep a file explorer tab there
- Go to the terminal by pressing the Windows key and searching "terminal"
- Make sure you have Python 3 installed, as well as the library "pygame" (there's plenty of tutorials on YouTube on how to install these)
- Go to the top of file explorer and copy the file directory <CTRL+C>
- Type "cd <CTRL+V>", which should put you in the correct file directory
- Type "python main.py", it should work once you type that in!
